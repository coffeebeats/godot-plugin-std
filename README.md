# godot-plugin-std

A Godot 4.0+ plugin providing standard GDScript functions and components.

## Usage

### Add as a dependency

To use this plugin, add this repository as a submodule of a Godot project (typically under the `addons` directory). The following section lists which version should be used depending on the project's supported Godot version.

#### Branch name / Release tag: Godot version

- `main` / `v1`: `v4.3`
- `v0`: `v4.2`

### Plugin API

### **`config`**

The [config](./config) directory contains replacement classes for `ConfigFile`, [which shouldn't be used due to security issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/80562). The [`Config`](./config/config.gd) class is an in-memory, typed, categorized key-value store. To synchronize the configuration data to the file system, use [`ConfigWithFileSync`](./config/file.gd) instead.

### **`fsm`**

The [fsm](./fsm) directory contains an implementation of a hierarchical [`StateMachine`](./fsm/state_machine.gd) suited for most applications. State machines are constructed as a scene with the node hierarchy used to define the level of state nesting. Each state should utilize a custom script to implement its behavior, and users can input events into the state machine to trigger transitions or update states.

Additionally, the [`StateMachine`](./fsm/state_machine.gd) implementation provides a "compaction" process which is enabled by default. The state machine extracts the scripts of all child [`State`](./fsm/state.gd) nodes and stores those objects internally without adding children to the scene tree. This improves performance, especially for state machines which are instantiated often.

### **`iter`**

The [iter](./iter) directory contains helpful functions for interacting with sequences and collections of various types.

### **`scene`**

The [scene](./scene) directory contains an implementation of a [`StateMachine`](./fsm/state_machine.gd) specialized for declaratively managing scene transitions. See the [examples folder](./scene/example/) for a sample main scene.

## **Development**

### Setup

The following instructions outline how to get the project set up for local development:

1. Clone this repository using the `--recurse-submodules` flag, ensuring all submodules are initialized. Alternatively, run `git submodule sync` to update all submodules to latest.
2. [Follow the instructions](https://github.com/coffeebeats/gdenv/blob/main/docs/installation.md) to install `gdenv`. Then, install the [pinned version of Godot](./.godot-version) with `gdenv i`.
3. Install the tools [used below](#code-submission) by following each of their specific installation instructions.

### Code submission

When submitting code for review, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. The project adheres as closely as possible to the official [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).

2. The project is correctly formatted using [gdformat](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit/wiki/4.-Formatter):

    ```sh
    bin/gdformat -l 88 --check **/*.gd
    ```

3. All [gdlint](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit/wiki/3.-Linter) linter warnings are addressed:

    ```sh
    bin/gdlint **/*.gd
    ```

4. All [Gut](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) unit tests pass:

    ```sh
    godot \
        --quit \
        --headless \
        -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd \
        -gdir="res://" \
        -ginclude_subdirs \
        -gprefix="" \
        -gsuffix="_test.gd" \
        -gexit
    ```
